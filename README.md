# SIM Hangman API #

In this assignment we ask you to implement a minimal version of a hangman API using the following resources below:

## Resources ##

**/games (POST)**

Start a new game

- A list of words can be found in the MySQL database. At the start of the game a random word should be picked from this list.

**/games/[:id] (PUT)**

Guess a started game

- Guessing a correct letter doesn’t decrement the amount of tries left

- Only valid characters are a-z

## Response ##

Every response should contain the following fields:

*word*: representation of the word that is being guessed. Should contain dots for letters that have not been guessed yet (e.g. aw.so..)

*tries_left*: the number of tries left to guess the word (starts at 11)

*status*: current status of the game (busy|fail|success)

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
